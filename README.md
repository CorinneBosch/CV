Hello there!👋

As Full-Stack junior developer with an ever-curious mind and a creative background in Michelin-star fine dining, I am most comfortable out of my comfort zone. 

Discovering coding somewhat by coincidence while pursuing my interest in UX/UI design, I got instantly hooked with the challenging, problem-solving and forceful nature of this craft and its exciting community. I am passionate about writing high-quality, test-driven and reusable code, to positively impact others. 

After learning so much at a rapid pace at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech), I am keen to continue learning new technologies. I am looking for a supportive culture that values open communication, where I can contribute to developing inclusive platforms.

| [GiftHub](https://github.com/CorinneBosch/gift-hub)            | A platform allowing users to send & receive small gifts to friends. I enjoyed challenging myself to be more hands-on with structuring the back-end and database interactions, compared to other projects. Learning MERN stack for our final engineering project in only two weeks was ambitious. Our group achieved this through solid planning and overcoming challenges together by supporting one another. | MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Jest, Cypress |        |

| [Acebook](https://github.com/CorinneBosch/acebook)             | Card-game inspired Facebook clone, created as part of a group project at Makers over two weeks. I contributed to implementing secure user authentication, uploading files with Active Storage to AWS and giving Acebook its unique interface. While sticking to agile processes and excellent communication, our team is really proud of our first Rails application. | Ruby on Rails, jQuery, Active Record, Rspec, Capybara | &nbsp; <a href="https://whispering-woodland-40745.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" > <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/heroku/heroku-plain.svg" alt="acebook_heroku" width="40" height="40" /> </a> |

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Inquisitive:** Learning and researching is my incentive in life. Going down a rabbit hole off that perfect regex or exploring the origin of unusual pepper corn varieties. ([Cubeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_cubeba) pepper is my favourite!) This shows in my commitment to problem solving and optimising code.
- **Adaptive:** Working in diverse kitchen environments in London, Sydney, Corvara (Italy) and Zürich. I often had to pick up new techniques in a matter of minutes and implement them right away in a fast-paced environment. I have learned to adapt to new teams and pick up skills swiftly, finding a way to connect with everyone. At Makers, my adaptability allowed me to learn new languages and technologies quickly. Looking at new challenges as opportunities to grow in a team or as an individual.
- **Commitment:** With no prior experience in coding, I taught myself the solid basics of Ruby, through Treehouse and CodeCademy. Preparing for Makers while still working full-time, required daily discipline and focus. As a resilient and highly motivated individual, I do not shy away from difficult challenges or time consuming tasks.
- **Attention to detail:** My fine dining background has given me a keen eye for fine details, by plating delicate dishes with a dozen components. This comes through in my coding, from designing all my CSS from scratch (without relying on libraries) - to finding that one tiny bug.
- **Creativity:** As a recipe developer and food stylist, I am used to expressing my creativity through food and telling a story. My creative mind helps me think outside of the box and be creative with my problem-solving. I enjoy exploring and implementing CSS with a neat user experience to design inclusive websites.

**Foreign Languages:** native Swiss-German and German, French B1

## <a name="interests">Interests</a>

**🏃🏻‍♀️ &nbsp; Running:** Competing in athletics exposed me to my love for long-distance running. The simplicity of running enables me to free my mind and connect with nature. It also allows me to challenge my limits and improve my mental & physical endurance.

**🍲 &nbsp; Cooking:** Growing up with a vibrant garden I developed my passion for food and cooking at an early stage. Discovering unique produce inspires me to research foreign food cultures and connect with people through food. Being able to learn infinite new cooking techniques always intrigued me while pursuing my career in hospitality and motivated me to expand my skills. I draw a lot of similarities to this when coding, allowing me to feed my curiosity by learning new things every day.

**6 Fun facts about me**

🍇👩🏻‍🌾🥕 &nbsp; Farmer’s markets are my happy place, strolling through fruit & veggie stalls is my equivalent of a child’s ultimate candy store phantasy.

😴💭👩🏻‍💻 &nbsp; More often than not I dream in puts statements which is just about as satisfying as it sounds.

🍦🥭🍨 &nbsp; Advocating to change ice cream’s reputation in our society, to not be limited to a dessert choice only. So that ice cream addicts such as myself can eat ice cream anytime and anywhere.

☕️🥞📖 &nbsp; If I could list daydreaming & people-watching in café window seats as a skill, I would. Self-proclaimed coffee believer and I truly deem you can determine people’s personalities by how they enjoy their daily portion of liquid gold.

🎸🎵🍅 &nbsp; Never make me choose a favourite music artist or fruit, but I had to - it would be Jack White & tomatoes.

❄️🎿🫕 &nbsp; Growing up in a village with more cows than inhabitants, I learned skiing & walking at around the same time and choose powdery Swiss mountains over a beach holiday any minute.
